# Stock Predictions and Relationships

This project is meant to:
1) Use the Yahoo Finance API to extract daily closing price, volume, and market capitalization of select stocks within the S&P500, NASDAQ, Russell 100, and Dow
2) Identify and evaluate relationships between stocks to identify factors in price movements
3) Develop a machine learning model to predict prices based on historical data and compare with the actual prices

## Results

1) The machine learning model identified which stocks (e.g., ROKU, SNAP) seem to have an impact in NIO's price movements
2) The model can somewhat predict future prices, but could be improved when compared to the actual closing prices of a certain trading day

## Next steps

1) Identify other factors besides stocks that relate to price movements (e.g., news sentiment, dividends, split)
2) Improve on prediction model for future prices based on historical data. One example may be to use a smaller subset of data (e.g., 3 weeks instead of 3 months)
3) Evaluate the performance of the model using other evaluation metrics
