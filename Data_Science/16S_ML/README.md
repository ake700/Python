# Predictive machine learning based on several students' 16S rRNA gene sequencing datasets.

Included are a copy of 16S rRNA CSV for the phyla in addition to the Jupyter Notebook associated with the model.

The model explored in this project is the Random Forest Regressor, but future work will explore other time-series models based on the [scikit-learn page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) and others.
