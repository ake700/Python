Final remarks 
This study aimed to provide an alternative approach to controlling C. sakazakii by using an in vitro gut model to simulate the colonic metabolome and microbiota of a onemonth infant. The antimicrobial properties of various LAB strains were assessed and later on their compatibility to grow in a commercial prebiotic substrate was evaluated. A combination of Pediococcus and former Lactobacillus strains with a commercial prebiotic substrate alongside potential probiotics consisting of the select LAB strains was determined to make the potential synbiotic to be used in the SHIME as outlined in Chapter . The goal of the SHIME was to reduce C. sakazakii levels through the use of the potential probiotics and synbiotic and to compare the efficacy between the two treatments over a twoweek treatment period. 
Additionally we evaluated any changes in the infant SHIME metabolome and microbiota as a result of C. sakazakii and the aforementioned treatments. The potential synbiotic had a distinct impact on the gut metabolome which could be explained by the higher species diversity in the first treatment period. In addition the timing of the treatment could have had an impact on the changes in the metabolomic profiles observed between the SHIMEs that received the treatment. 
Further analysis revealed that the reduction in levels of C. sakazakii in the SHIME system without any treatment could be due to the presence of Bifidobacterium spp. as shown by the significant negative correlation. In contrast regardless of the timing of the application the potential synbiotic reduced C. sakazakii levels which may be due to the production of antimicrobial metabolites like acetate. This study provided some insight into the various methods in which our native gut microbiota can adapt to the presence of foodborne pathogens even in early infancy as highlighted in Chapter . As expected with a complex gut model and evaluation of the gut metabolome and microbiota there were several limitations associated with this study as noted in Chapter . However and perhaps more importantly this study demonstrated the usefulness of the SHIME in helping to analyze the trends in the gut metabolome and microbiota. The directions adaptations and improvements to be made based on this thesis have also been highlighted in Chapter . Overall the results obtained in this study can help to provide a deeper understanding of how we can study and control foodborne pathogens within the gut of an infant.
